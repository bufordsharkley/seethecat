    <p>In an episode that critics are calling &#34;overlong&#34;, the Earful gang picks apart the 18th five minutes of Convoy in very much the same way that Rubber Duck and pals pick apart Alvarez, Texas. Updates on a new feud with Chip Davis&#39;s publicists, comparisons with the Wild Bunch, C.W. McCall&#39;s surprising net worth, and the holidays.

  <a href="/ep/19">Earful of Convoy: Episode 19 (1:30:00 - 1:35:00)</a>
  <marquee>A meaty chunk of Convoy analysis for all the Convoyheads out there! Alan and Hervey really expore the social and political implications of the 19th five minutes, finding a surprisingly coherent anarcho-syndicalist message. (Maybe Old Sam was a good Union Man after all!) Meanwhile, we discuss the hypothetical sequel (Convoy 2: Mr Duck Goes to Washington), get our hands dirty with &#34;Cannon Fodder&#34;, eat some matzoh, and apply the appropriate amount of hand-wringing for our part in normalizing President-Elect Trump. But ultimately, we must never forget, it&#39;s *Melissa&#39;s Five Minutes*.</marquee>
