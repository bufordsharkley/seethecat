  <div>2018-05-12 at 9:00 AM</div>
  <div class="eppagedescription">
    <p>Michael Goldman is a councilperson for Sunnyvale City Council. We recently had an extensive conversation about affordable housing at a Denny's after a council meeting, and are extended it onto the airwaves. It certainly seems that we disagree fundamentally about everything, but after we share ideas, what can we learn? Plenty of talk about urban economics and land markets.

  <div class="eppagedescription">
    <p>Max Kapczynski of Palo Alto Forward is back, to talk about recent goings-on in Palo Alto. An affordable housing overlay made its way through council, but what does it *really* mean about the housing situation at large. We expand this into a conversation about developers, and how money is made. Some claim they're no different than anybody else offering a service, and some claim that their form of making money is inherently immoral. Who's right?
