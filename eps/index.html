  <div class="eppagedescription">
    <p>We talk to James Howard Kunstler, who has long been a voice railing against the ugliness of modern sprawl and the psychic torment things brings on ourselves. How does a land tax offer a possible answer to this tragedy?

  <div>2017-05-30 at 10:00 AM</div>
  <div class="eppagedescription">
    <p>Last November, Berkeley passed Measure U1, nicknamed the &#34;Landlord Tax.&#34; It increased the tax rate for landlords of five or more rental units. Behind the bill was Stephen Barton, who&#39;s been working for affordable housing for decades. On the side, he&#39;s been writing about the Georgist history of Berkeley&#39;s leadership.

  <div>2017-05-23 at 10:00 AM</div>
  <div class="eppagedescription">
    <p>Tomas Piketty showed that accumulation of capital was driving modern inequality. But then a young economics student showed how scarcity of housing explains Piketty&#39;s phenomenon, not accumulation. We&#39;re joined by Professor Nic Tideman of Virginia Tech, to discuss Matthew Rognlie&#39;s influential paper.

  <div class="eppagedescription">
    <p>Corey Smith of the San Francisco Housing Action Coalition talks about the policies and the politics to get the housing supply up to 5,000 units a year. All your favorites are here: CEQA and Prop 13. Some talk about the limits of empathy: are our land-use policies making us meaner?&#34;

  <div class="eppagedescription">
    <p>Zoltan Istvan ran for President on the Transhumanist party, and is now running for California Governor as a Libertarian. He proposes a Universal Basic Income, funded by the leasing of federal lands. How does this compare to the Georgist ideal of a citizen&#39;s dividend funded by land rents?
