    <title>Zoltan Istvan: Funding a UBI</title>
    <description>Zoltan Istvan ran for President on the Transhumanist party, and is now running for California Governor as a Libertarian. He proposes a Universal Basic Income, funded by the leasing of federal lands. How does this compare to the Georgist ideal of a citizen&#39;s dividend funded by land rents?

    <title>Nic Tideman on the Rognlie/Piketty controversy</title>
    <description>Tomas Piketty showed that accumulation of capital was driving modern inequality. But then a young economics student showed how scarcity of housing explains Piketty&#39;s phenomenon, not accumulation.

    <title>The Palo Alto Process and the (Im)morality of Developers, with Max Kapczynski</title>
    <description>Max Kapczynski of Palo Alto Forward is back, to talk about recent goings-on in Palo Alto. An affordable housing overlay made its way through council, but what does it *really* mean about the housing situation at large. We expand this into a conversation about developers, and how money is made. Some claim they&#39;re no different than anybody else offering a service, and some claim that their form of making money is inherently immoral. Who&#39;s right?

    <title>Richard Mehlinger on Sunnyvale: Corn Palace, Blue Bonnet, and weak protections for tenants</title>
    <description>We talk Sunnyvale with Richard Mehlinger of Livable Sunnyvale, and Max Kapczynski of Palo Alto Forward. Sunnyvale still has a corn field, which is going to be developed... into single family homes (?!?!?!). We talk why, as well as the history and latest with the evictions of the Blue Bonnet mobile home park, to be turned into relatively low-density townhomes. Who bears the weight of change in Sunnyvale, and why? Too, we talk about the future of expanding tenant protections to Sunnyvale renters through a 12-Month Lease program, and how Catholic social teachings have influenced Richard&#39;s thinking.

Jordan, though, is a San Matean born and raised. Paul Leone also joins the program to talk about how San Mateo thwarts affordable housing. We talk process and policy, including the extension of Measure P, to set a hard limit on possible density.

What exactly does this mean for rent stabilization programs, and how does this compare to other powers (such as that to tax) to take land rents away from landlords?

    <title>Spotlite on Vancouver, with Jennifer Bradshaw</title>
    <description>Vancouver is a city with housing policies that are the dream of the Bay Area, with an recent end to single-family zoning as well as stronger tenant protections, but yet exclusion and tenant instability still persist. What more could Vancouver do to address this, and could a move by City Council to introduce a Land Value Tax help? Jennifer Bradshaw talks about this, her work in housing activism, why housing opportunity matters to those who desperately need it, and why high vacancy rates are good for renters.

    <title>Holly Balcom on Portland Land-Use, Tenant Protections, and Land Taxes</title>
    <description>Holly Balcom tells us how, compared to the Bay Area, Portland, Oregon does so many things better: better cooperation between land-use groups and tenant groups, coherent regional government, an anti-sprawl Urban Growth Boundary, and even the exploration of land taxes. However, pushing back against suburban conformity and exclusion, NIMBYism, and unaffordability is very much an active challenge, and Holly lets us know about what&#39;s been going well, and what still needs attention in Portland.

    <title>Georgism vs Yimbyism Debate; Opponent Sonja Trauss</title>
    <description>What&#39;s mightier, redistributing land vs building more housing? Are these ideologies necessarily at ends, and what&#39;s their respective roles in the current housing scene? Sonja Trauss of SFBARF/SF YIMBY/CaRLA makes the case that georgists are too focused on taxing the land to see that zoning needs reformed. Other topics are broached, from property rights, political orgs, and whether sweeping wealth redistribution is needed (we quickly agree it is).

How has Mountain View been able to address equitable solutions for housing better than its neighbors, and how can it do more? We also debate the contentious issue of local control, with Pardis Beikzadeh and David Watson of South Bay YIMBY saying that state intervention is necessary, and Lenny saying that other (perhaps bigger) solutions are needed.

    <title>State-wide Rent Cap/Just Cause, Local Urgency Ordinances, with Stasha Powell and Jordan Grimes</title>
    <description>Sacramento passed state-wide protections to limit rent increases and prevent just cause evictions, a real win for renters. BUT: various loopholes led to the need for a series of urgency ordinances on a city-by-city basis to prevent last-minute evictions. We hear from Stasha Powell, tenant activist (of One Redwood City) and Jordan Grimes (of Peninsula for Everyone) to hear about these actions, and some general thoughts about the challenges of implementation, and the future of tenant rights in California and beyond.
