    <title>Zoltan Istvan: Funding a UBI</title>
    <description>Zoltan Istvan ran for President on the Transhumanist party, and is now running for California Governor as a Libertarian. He proposes a Universal Basic Income, funded by the leasing of federal lands. How does this compare to the Georgist ideal of a citizen&#39;s dividend funded by land rents?

    <title>Nic Tideman on the Rognlie/Piketty controversy</title>
    <description>Tomas Piketty showed that accumulation of capital was driving modern inequality. But then a young economics student showed how scarcity of housing explains Piketty&#39;s phenomenon, not accumulation. We&#39;re joined by Professor Nic Tideman of Virginia Tech, to discuss Matthew Rognlie&#39;s influential paper.
