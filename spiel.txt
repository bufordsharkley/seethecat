Welcome to the Henry George Program, I’m Mark Mollineaux, and I’m joined by
co-host Jacob Shwartz-Lucas,

This is a program dedicated to finding practical
answers to the housing crisis, economic volatility, inequality, and
environmental degradation here in the Bay Area and beyond.  We compare and
contrast the ideas of the 19th century economist Henry George with that of both
historical and contemporary thinkers. Also addressed are issues ranging from
artificial intelligence, automatization, and universal basic income -to city
planning and the land value tax, a concept popularized by George.
