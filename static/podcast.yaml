     description: >
       Zoltan Istvan ran for President on the Transhumanist party, and is now
       running for California Governor as a Libertarian. He proposes a
       Universal Basic Income, funded by the leasing of federal lands. How does
       this compare to the Georgist ideal of a citizen's dividend funded by
       land rents?

       the policies and the politics to get the housing supply up to 5,000
       units a year. All your favorites are here: CEQA and Prop 13. Some talk

   - title: "Rognlie on Piketty, with Nic Tideman"
     description: >
       Tomas Piketty showed that accumulation of capital was driving modern
       inequality. But then a young economics student showed how scarcity of
       housing explains Piketty's phenomenon, not accumulation. We're joined by
       Professor Nic Tideman of Virginia Tech, to discuss Matthew Rognlie's
       influential paper.

   - title: "Stephen Barton and the Berkeley Landlord Tax"
     description: >
       Last November, Berkeley passed Measure U1, nicknamed the "Landlord Tax."
       It increased the tax rate for landlords of five or more rental units.
       Behind the bill was Stephen Barton, who's been working for affordable
       housing for decades. On the side, he's been writing about the Georgist
       history of Berkeley's leadership.

       We talk to James Howard Kunstler, who has long been a voice railing
       against the ugliness of modern sprawl and the psychic torment things

       tragedy?

       workers about how housing policy affects them, and what they can do.
       Josh Vincent advises land policy on a city-by-city basis using open data

       about it.

       Victoria Fierce works for (pro-housing) East Bay Forward. Victoria
       Fierce is a member of (pro-economic-justice) DSA. This has led to an
       undue amount of drama.  Does this have to be so? Why can't socialists
