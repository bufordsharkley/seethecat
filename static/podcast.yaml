     description: >
       Mark Mollineaux, Jacob Schwartz-Lucas, and Edward Miller discuss the
       land-use policies of Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and more. How
       responsible is municipal ownership to land to the world-class
       infrastructure and vibrant economies of these cities?

     description: >
       Zoltan Istvan ran for President on the Transhumanist party, and is now
       running for California Governor as a Libertarian. He proposes a
       Universal Basic Income, funded by the leasing of federal lands. How does
       this compare to the Georgist ideal of a citizen's dividend funded by
       land rents?

     description: >
       We talk Sunnyvale with Richard Mehlinger of Livable Sunnyvale, and Max
       Kapczynski of Palo Alto Forward. Sunnyvale still has a corn field, which
       is going to be developed... into single family homes (?!?!?!). We talk
       why, as well as the history and latest with the evictions of the Blue
       Bonnet mobile home park, to be turned into relatively low-density
       townhomes. Who bears the weight of change in Sunnyvale, and why? Too, we
       talk about the future of expanding tenant protections to Sunnyvale
       renters through a 12-Month Lease program, and how Catholic social
       teachings have influenced Richard's thinking.

       Jordan Grimes is an activist for housing and transporation in San Mateo,
       where efforts to add housing capacity are often met with hostility from
       homeowners, who often trace the city's problems to an influx of tech
       workers. Jordan, though, is a San Matean born and raised. Paul Leone
       also joins the program to talk about how San Mateo thwarts affordable
       housing. We talk process and policy, including the extension of Measure
       P, to set a hard limit on possible density.

       <a href="https://blog.yonathan.org/posts/2018-09-proposition-10-rent-control.html">recent
       article</a>, it interacts with a body of legal precedent that reflects
       what "fair rate of return" a landlord shall receive. What exactly does
       this mean for rent stabilization programs, and how does this compare to
       other powers (such as that to tax) to take land rents away from
       landlords?
