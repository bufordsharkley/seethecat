     description: >
       Mark Mollineaux, Jacob Schwartz-Lucas, and Edward Miller discuss the
       land-use policies of Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and more. How
       responsible is municipal ownership to land to the world-class
       infrastructure and vibrant economies of these cities?

     description: >
       Zoltan Istvan ran for President on the Transhumanist party, and is now
       running for California Governor as a Libertarian. He proposes a
       Universal Basic Income, funded by the leasing of federal lands. How does
       this compare to the Georgist ideal of a citizen's dividend funded by
       land rents?

       inequality. But then a young economics student showed how scarcity of
       housing explains Piketty's phenomenon, not accumulation. We're joined by
       Professor Nic Tideman of Virginia Tech, to discuss Matthew Rognlie's
       influential paper.

       Last November, Berkeley passed Measure U1, nicknamed the "Landlord Tax."
       It increased the tax rate for landlords of five or more rental units.
       Behind the bill was Stephen Barton, who's been working for affordable
       housing for decades. On the side, he's been writing about the Georgist
       history of Berkeley's leadership.

       Josh Vincent advises land policy on a city-by-city basis using open data
