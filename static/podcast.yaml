     description: >
       Mark Mollineaux, Jacob Schwartz-Lucas, and Edward Miller discuss the
       land-use policies of Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and more. How
       responsible is municipal ownership to land to the world-class
       infrastructure and vibrant economies of these cities?

   - title: "Zoltan Istvan: Funding a UBI"
     description: >
       Zoltan Istvan ran for President on the Transhumanist party, and is now
       running for California Governor as a Libertarian. He proposes a
       Universal Basic Income, funded by the leasing of federal lands. How does
       this compare to the Georgist ideal of a citizen's dividend funded by
       land rents?

     description: >
       Corey Smith of the San Francisco Housing Action Coalition talks about
       the policies and the politics to get the housing supply up to 5,000
       units a year. All your favorites are here: CEQA and Prop 13. Some talk
       about the limits of empathy: are our land-use policies making us meaner?

   - title: "Nic Tideman on the Rognlie/Piketty controversy"
     description: >
       Tomas Piketty showed that accumulation of capital was driving modern
       inequality. But then a young economics student showed how scarcity of
       housing explains Piketty's phenomenon, not accumulation. We're joined by
       Professor Nic Tideman of Virginia Tech, to discuss Matthew Rognlie's
       influential paper.

   - title: "Stephen Barton and the Berkeley Landlord Tax"
     description: >
       Last November, Berkeley passed Measure U1, nicknamed the "Landlord Tax."
       It increased the tax rate for landlords of five or more rental units.
       Behind the bill was Stephen Barton, who's been working for affordable
       housing for decades. On the side, he's been writing about the Georgist
       history of Berkeley's leadership.

     description: >
       We talk to James Howard Kunstler, who has long been a voice railing
       against the ugliness of modern sprawl and its attendant psychic torment.
       How does a land tax offer a possible answer to this tragedy?

     description: >
       Jeff Andrade-Fong works with Tech for Housing to bring attention to tech
       workers about how housing policy affects them, and what they can do.
       Josh Vincent advises land policy on a city-by-city basis using open data
       and more. Changing policy is hard, but we talk about what people can do
       about it.

       Katy Tang represents the Sunset on the SF Board of Supervisors, and has
       led Home-SF, which works to end displacement while still building more

       Victoria Fierce works for (pro-housing) East Bay Forward. Victoria
       Fierce is a member of (pro-economic-justice) DSA. This has led to an
       undue amount of drama.  Does this have to be so? Why can't socialists
       and YIMBYs get along?

     description: >
       Let's head back to the early nineties―Prop 13 was upheld by the U.S.
       Supreme Court in an 8-1 decision, and Jack Miller wrote a <a
       href="http://scholarlycommons.law.hofstra.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2509&context=hlr">66-page
       barnburner about the injustice in the decision</a>. We have Jack Miller
       on to talk about the jurisprudence of fair taxes, the importance of
       Horizontal Equity, and how this all came together in Nordlinger v Hahn.

       against AI superintelligence, and thoughts on how human values can be

       fixing broken markets.

       We have Matt Krisiloff of YC Research to talk about the Basic Income
       project, Y Combinator's United Slate (which featured LVT as a plank).
       Should these be viewed as separate, or two ideas that are fundamentally
       linked? Also a conversation with Kedar about the technical and moral
       merits of a UBI versus a Jobs Guarantee.

       the program to explain the ins and outs of some of the weirder and wilder
       economic laboratories out there: videogames. How does scarcity in Eve
       Online resemble real estate bubbles? What does Second Life tell us about
       marginal land?

       A roundtable discussion on how the issue of critical goods (water, food,
       fuel) is treated after a natural disaster. Is raising prices necessarily
       immoral? When is rationing necessary? And how can this be tied into
       theories of value?
