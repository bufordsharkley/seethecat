       Zoltan Istvan ran for President on the Transhumanist party, and is now

       Universal Basic Income, funded by the leasing of federal lands. How does
       this compare to the Georgist ideal of a citizen's dividend funded by
       land rents?

       It increased the tax rate for landlords of five or more rental units.
       Behind the bill was Stephen Barton, who's been working for affordable
       housing for decades. On the side, he's been writing about the Georgist
       history of Berkeley's leadership.

       Max Kapczynski of Palo Alto Forward is back, to talk about recent
       goings-on in Palo Alto. An affordable housing overlay made its way through
       council, but what does it *really* mean about the housing situation at
       large. We expand this into a conversation about developers, and how money
       is made. Some claim they're no different than anybody else offering a
       service, and some claim that their form of making money is inherently
       immoral. Who's right?

       Lenny Siegel served on the Mountain View City Council from 2014-2018,
       serving one term as mayor, and has been a lifelong activist for
       progressive causes. How has Mountain View been able to address equitable
       solutions for housing better than its neighbors, and how can it do more?
       We also debate the contentious issue of local control, with Pardis
       Beikzadeh and David Watson of South Bay YIMBY saying that state
       intervention is necessary, and Lenny saying that other (perhaps bigger)
       solutions are needed.

       speculation to grow faster than its competitors? What special
       relationships did the rise of McDonald's have in common with
       suburbanization? And should McDonald's just go all-in on becoming a
       REIT?
